This E-commerce store was built with React JS and is hosted on vercel. It is a frontend project with a django backend and mongo database.

I made use of the backend API for fetching all of the product data and for user authentication so users can sign-up and sign-in to their account in order to buy products.

The backend was built by a friend of mine using django rest framework and mongo database.

I made use of redux toolkit for all state management of the website which includes adding products to cart, deleting product from cart, clearing cart and cart checkout.
The project also has an in-built light/dark theme mode which I did using Context API and CSS.

I also made use of paystack for payment integration
The project was styled with Tailwind CSS
